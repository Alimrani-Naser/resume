        \item {Architected and built a time-series database with Cassandra to store terabytes of smart meter data. The wrapping service is written in Java. It has been running for 4 years, receiving 70 million new readings a day and 4 million reads, with hardly any maintenance or support.}

        \item {Handled technical recruiting for new developers. Crafted the coding challenge given to new applicants and score every submission.}

Setup our monitoring stack (which uses Logstash, Kibana, Graphite, and Statsd). Forked and tweaked the open-source Graphiti project for creating Graphite dashboards.}
        \item {Involved in writing algorithms for forecasting energy use. Have my name on a patent for a algorithm for predictive energy curves, which I'm both proud and ashamed of (because software patents should be illegal).}
