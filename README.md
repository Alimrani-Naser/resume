**Principal Software Engineer** at **Pulse Energy (Acquired by EnerNOC and Yardi)** from **September 2008 - Present**

Setup our monitoring stack (which uses Logstash, Kibana, Graphite, and Statsd). Forked and tweaked the open-source Graphiti project for creating Graphite dashboards.
* Involved in writing algorithms for forecasting energy use. Have my name on a patent for a algorithm for predictive energy curves, which I'm both proud and ashamed of (because software patents should be illegal).
